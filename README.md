TSRLine
=======
TSRLine is a simple class that allows you to create and use a line, from one point to another, in a standard UIView.

Just use **[TSRLine addFrom:]** to get and add a line instance from point a to point b, setting your line width, color, and parent view in that instance.

To change a line you already have, use **setFrom:** with the same parameters.
